            <h2>Gymnogyps californianus - The California condor</h2>
            <h5>Part 1</h5>
    
            For over 40,000 years, the California condor has been soaring the great north American skies. This long history dates back to the Pleistocene Epoch where most of the world was covered in snow glaciers and before humans ever came to America. 
            <p></p>
            Itâ€™s long history with its land means its significance to it is great, both within its ecology and culturally through countless stories passed down by mouth for generations by Native Americans. Through its unique diet of carrion, they allow new life to prosper from the dead.  
            <p></p>
            These giant birds are known as a symbol of death, renewal and rebirth thanks to their recognizable shape, unique behavior and diet -however in recent times, things have changed, including the way we think about animals.

            As a scavenging animal, it easily serves as a role of a sentinel species. The condors sensitivity to the life and toxins of the animals that it eats is present as anything the carcass has eaten, the condor eats as well. This unique position means that the well-being of the condors can roughly translate to how well off the current ecosystem health is. 
            <p></p>
            Having a diet that consists of both marine and terrestrial carrion means it can determine the heath of both ecosystems in the area.
